# Pedestrian-Tracking-Corner-Detection-of-Autonomous-Car-Using-NXP-S32V234-Vision-Processor.
Car having captured image was processed using APEX graph tool from S32V234 Design studio for Vison with S32V234 Processor. Fast9 based ORB algorithm was used to track pedestrian and detect corner which was taken as input to take decisions of an autonomous car.
